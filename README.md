# 🎮 Unity Games Collection

This repository contains Unity projects for a collection of beginner to intermediate-level games developed as part of learning and experimenting with Unity. Each project is self-contained and focuses on different aspects of game development such as physics, input handling, 2D/3D rendering, and simulation.

## 🧩 Projects Included

### 1. **Roll A Ball**
- A simple 3D game where the player controls a ball to collect objects on the field.
- Focus Areas: Rigidbody physics, input handling, camera follow.

### 2. **Plane Simulator**
- A basic flight simulation where the user controls a plane in a 3D environment.
- Focus Areas: Flight physics, 3D movement, camera rotation, and terrain.

### 3. **Car Simulator**
- Simulates driving mechanics of a car within a terrain.
- Focus Areas: Wheel colliders, physics-based controls, and environmental interaction.

### 4. **Angry Bird**
- A physics-based 2D game inspired by the popular Angry Birds.
- Focus Areas: 2D physics, projectile mechanics, and collision detection.

### 5. **2D Runner**
- A side-scrolling endless runner game with increasing difficulty.
- Focus Areas: Parallax background, procedural spawning, jump/dash mechanics.
